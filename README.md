# Veeam Decoys
**Author**: Marco Escobar marco.escobar@veeam.com

This is an **open-source** project where multiple decoys have been created for various Veeam services and remote administration services to detect Discovery (TA0007) and Lateral Movements (TA0008) of threat actors within the organization's **internal** networks.

- Veeam Backup Server
- Veeam Hardened Repository
- Veeam Windows Repository
- Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager
- SSH
- Remote Desktop (RDP)
- Netbios

And the following characteristics:

- Terminal User Interface
- Logs
- Log Forwarding to SysLog Server
- Email Notifications
- Multiple Network Interface Configuration
- List of Used Ports
- Service Management
- Configuration File Editing
- Remote Management


Each service allows for the detection of connection attempts and scans to the different ports used by each service, capturing credentials, IP addresses, source ports, source IP addresses, and specific queries to certain services. All captures are generated in Syslog format to be forwarded to a centralized Syslog server or to send notifications by email.
Additionally, this solution supports the use of multiple network interfaces, it's possible to implement the services across multiple networks, thus allowing for a distributed deployment of the services.
